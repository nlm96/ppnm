Evaluating Artificial Neural Networks

Total hidden neurons: 6
Objective: Interpolating f2(x) = Cos(5*x-1)*Exp(-x*x)
Using a Gaussian wavelet as the activation function for the neurons

Number of steps to minimize the Cost function in the neural network: 99999

Interpolation can be seen in interpolation.svg

The first and second derivatives and the anti-derivative
can be seen in Plot.svg along with the analytical solutions.
