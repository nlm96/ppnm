Part (A):
The solution to the harmonic osciallator u'' = -u with initial values: u(0) = 1, u'(0) = 0 is plotted in harmonic_oscillator.data.svg
The damped harmonic osciallator: theta''(t) + b*theta'(t) + c*sin(theta(t)) = 0, 
 with boundary conditions: theta(0) = pi - 0.1,  omega(0) = 0 
is plotted and solved in damped_oscillator.data.svg. 


Part (B):
The solution to the Lotka-Volterra system is plotted and solved in lotka_volterra.data.svg.

 
Part (c):

The three body problem is solved an plotted in threebody.gif
